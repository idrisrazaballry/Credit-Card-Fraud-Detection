# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

An end-to-end Machine Learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using highly imbalanced transaction data. The system applies data preprocessing, imbalance handling techniques, multiple ML models, explainability tools, and deployment using FastAPI + Streamlit.

---

## Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a major challenge in the financial industry. Fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to legitimate ones, which makes normal accuracy misleading.

This project builds a fraud detection pipeline that:

* Detects suspicious transactions with high recall
* Minimizes false positives
* Handles extreme class imbalance
* Explains predictions using SHAP
* Provides real-time fraud scoring API
* Includes a Streamlit dashboard

---

## Features

* Data preprocessing and feature scaling
* Handle class imbalance using SMOTE / ADASYN / Class Weights
* Train multiple ML models
* Threshold optimization for business cost reduction
* SHAP explainability
* FastAPI real-time prediction API
* Streamlit interactive dashboard

---

##  Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost
* LightGBM
* Imbalanced-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* SHAP
* FastAPI
* Streamlit
